My idea was to focus mainly on the "choose your own adventure" aspect to demonstrate linking html files. I used ascii art to illustrate some of the options/outcomes of the game. My game is based around a stranded island and starts with three options. Those options open new doors for a totaly of six html files. 

I started by sketching out the story figuring out how many html pages I needed to set up. From there, it was easy to put everything together once I had a map of the story. I realized that I needed one inital page(index.html) and then three pages for the three initial options the player is given. From there, two more pages were needed stemming off of one of the options. 

Below is a condensed version of the sketch I made to layout my story:

Inital Page

1.Option 1

2.Option 2

  2a.Option 2a

  2b.Option2b

3.Option 3
